abstract: We present a shock capturing method for unsteady laminar and turbulent flows. The proposed approach relies on physical principles to increase selected transport coefficients and resolve unstable sharp features, such as shock waves and strong thermal and shear gradients, over the smallest distance allowed by the discretization. In particular, we devise various sensors to detect when the shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid do not suffice to stabilize the numerical solution. In such cases, the transport coefficients are increased as necessary to optimally resolve these features with the available resolution. The performance of the method is illustrated through numerical simulation of external and internal flows in transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic regimes.

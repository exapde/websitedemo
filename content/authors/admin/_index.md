I am a principal research scientist at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests include computational mechanics, molecular mechanics, nanophotonics, numerical simulation and optimization, scientific computing, and machine learning. My research projects focus on reduced basis methods for parametrized partial differential equations, hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for multi-scale multi-physics simulations, hypersonic flow simulations, large eddy simulations, space weather prediction, atomistic and molecular simulations, nanoplasmonics, bandgap optimization, parallel computing on distributed systems, GPU computing.  I am actively contributing to open source projects. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging around and traveling with my family.  

<strong>Address</strong>: 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Office 37-371, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
<strong>Administrative contact</strong>: Andres Forero at aforero@mit.edu and 617-253-4926.

title: Lightning Initiation and Prevention
summary: Prediction of lightning initiation from an aircraft in flight is still at an early stage of research. Even though the phenomenological description of lightning initiation from aircraft is well accepted, a predictive mathematical formulation is well beyond today's understanding and computational capabilities. An improved physical description of the lightning initiation phenomena is important for prevention and protection. Our project has so far dealt with three areas (1) analytical and computational models of pre-strike electrostatics and leader initiation; (2) analytical and computational models of swept stroke physics; (3) lightning avoidance strategy based on a charge control method. This project is funded by the Boeing Company.
